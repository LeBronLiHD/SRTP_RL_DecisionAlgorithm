### introduction

##### brief description of RL

##### brief history and main algorithms of chess AI

- 1997 Deep Blue
  - alpha-beta
- 2016 Stockfish
  - similar with Deep Blue
- 2017 AlphaGo
  - policy value network
  - action value network
  - MCTS
- 2017 AlphaZero
  - entirely self-play
  - one neural network
  - simpler tree search

##### our Chinese-chess AI

- different structure
- different rules

### ideas about Chinese-chess AI

- Without human knowledge, the AI becomes its own teacher, training a neural network through fully autonomous reinforcement learning to select moves. 
- Each iteration results in higher quality move selection and stronger self-play. 
- Ultimately achieve the goal of surpassing human players.

### difference between current algorithms

- besic data structure

### achievements and evaluation

- beat log with alpha-beta and human players

### conclusion
